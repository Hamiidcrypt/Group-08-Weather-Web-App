##  Siyanbola AbdulHamiid (Group Leader)

Working on this project as the group leader has been both a rewarding and challenging experience. Taking responsibility for coordinating the team and ensuring that tasks were allocated fairly gave me the chance to practice leadership, organization, and communication skills in a practical setting. I learned how important it is to balance technical progress with maintaining team morale, and I often had to step in to keep things on track whenever we slowed down. The project taught me the value of planning ahead, setting deadlines, and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts.  

While I am proud of what we achieved, I also recognize that the journey could have been smoother if participation had been more evenly distributed. Some members were very engaged and contributed significantly, while others were less active. At times, this meant that I had to take on additional responsibilities to ensure we met our goals. I wish more team members had been consistently active, as this would have made the workload lighter and the collaboration richer. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the effort of those who participated fully, and I value the lessons I gained through leading.

## ðŸ§ª Eunice Harry (Tester)

Working on the Group 8 weather app project was a valuable learning experience. Through research and the help of my group members, I gained experience in Python web development using Flask, learned how to integrate external APIs for real-time weather data, and practiced writing automated tests to ensure code reliability.  

One challenge was understanding how to structure a web application and manage data flow between the backend and frontend. Through research and teamwork I learned the best practices for using templates. Working with the group improved my communication and teamwork skills.  

This project taught me the importance of testing and version control.
