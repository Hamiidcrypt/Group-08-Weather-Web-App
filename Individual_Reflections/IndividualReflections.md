##  Siyanbola AbdulHamiid (Group Leader)

Working on this project as the group leader has been both a rewarding and challenging experience. Taking responsibility for coordinating the team and ensuring that tasks were allocated fairly gave me the chance to practice leadership, organization, and communication skills in a practical setting. I learned how important it is to balance technical progress with maintaining team morale, and I often had to step in to keep things on track whenever we slowed down. The project taught me the value of planning ahead, setting deadlines, and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts.  

While I am proud of what we achieved, I also recognize that the journey could have been smoother if participation had been more evenly distributed. Some members were very engaged and contributed significantly, while others were less active. At times, this meant that I had to take on additional responsibilities to ensure we met our goals. I wish more team members had been consistently active, as this would have made the workload lighter and the collaboration richer. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the effort of those who participated fully, and I value the lessons I gained through leading.

## üß™ Eunice Harry (Tester)

Working on the Group 8 weather app project was a valuable learning experience. Through research and the help of my group members, I gained experience in Python web development using Flask, learned how to integrate external APIs for real-time weather data, and practiced writing automated tests to ensure code reliability.  

One challenge was understanding how to structure a web application and manage data flow between the backend and frontend. Through research and teamwork I learned the best practices for using templates. Working with the group improved my communication and teamwork skills.  
This project also taught me the importance of testing and version control.

## üß™ Muhammad Abubakar Atiku (Tester)

For this project, I worked as a Tester, focusing on ensuring the API Weather Dashboard functioned as expected. My responsibilities included writing automated tests with **pytest** and checking the app under different scenarios. I created tests for valid city inputs to confirm they returned accurate data, and for invalid or unknown cities to ensure the program handled errors gracefully. I also simulated network failures to observe how the app responded when the API was unreachable, which deepened my understanding of error handling in real-world applications.  

This role highlighted the importance of testing in professional programming. Running pytest and seeing cases pass was satisfying, as it gave our group confidence in the project‚Äôs reliability. The biggest challenge was balancing the limited time with the need to design meaningful tests. Since the project lasted only a week, I focused on the most critical cases rather than trying to cover everything.  

Working alongside developers was helpful‚Äîwhile they built core logic and UI, I concentrated on validation. Overall, this project strengthened my Python testing skills and improved my understanding of teamwork and GitHub workflow.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Daniel Oluwaseun Johnson  (Developer)

During the Python Advanced cohort project, I served as a developer on a team of eight that built a weather application. My main responsibility was designing and implementing the `models.py` file, which structured the app‚Äôs data and allowed smooth interaction across components. I also worked on integrating the external weather API, ensuring accurate responses and handling errors like failed requests. While debugging these issues was challenging at first, it helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and improve my understanding of API workflows.  

The team collaboration was a highlight of the project. Communication was effective, and everyone contributed in meaningful ways, which made solving technical challenges easier. I learned the importance of aligning individual contributions with the larger system and gained valuable experience in writing clean, reusable code.  

Overall, this project improved my Python skills, especially in data modeling and API handling, while also sharpening my teamwork abilities. I now feel more confident working on real-world applications that require collaboration, error handling, and structured design.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Babasanya AbdulSalam Feranmi  (Developer & Presenter)  

Working on the Group 8 Weather Application project was both exciting and rewarding. As one of the main developers, my role involved contributing to the backend logic and ensuring smooth integration of the weather API with our Flask application. I worked closely on structuring the data flow between different components and troubleshooting issues related to API responses and caching. This gave me the opportunity to improve my Python skills while learning how to build reliable, real-world web applications.  

In addition to my technical role, I will also serve as the project presenter. This responsibility allows me to practice communication and presentation skills by summarizing the team‚Äôs work and showcasing our application in a clear and engaging way. Preparing for the presentation helped me better understand the overall project architecture and the importance of teamwork in achieving success.  

While the project had challenges, especially in coordinating tasks within the limited timeline, I am proud of what we achieved. The experience improved both my technical development abilities and my confidence in speaking and representing a team.
